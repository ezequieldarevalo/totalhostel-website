      "title": "Quebrada de San Lorenzo",
      "description": "14 minutes from the city center, the Quebrada de San Lorenzo is the most beautiful and accessible place to walk through the Salta jungle, following the river's course. You can have lunch, afternoon tea, and dinner at the classic restaurant 'El Duende de la Quebrada'. You can get there by car or by bus line 4E 'San Lorenzo Chico'. This is the shortest and most direct route to the Quebrada. The bus can be taken four blocks from Total Hostel at Zuviría 598, on the corner with Rivadavia. The trip lasts about 30 minutes. We recommend visiting on weekdays for a quieter experience, or on weekends to meet people. There are also grills for rent where you can cook your own food or use public tables to enjoy a meal."

      "description": "In August 2024, an investigative commission was formed to explore tunnels supposedly built under the streets of the city during its founding period, used for the movement of weapons and people during the independence wars. It is estimated they connect historic buildings across at least 700 square meters of the historic center."

      "description": "The Province of Salta was one of the first provinces in the Republic of Argentina, founded in 1580. This explains the colonial architecture in the city center. Fortunately, today you can visit some of the most important historical landmarks like the Historical Museum of the North, located in front of Plaza 9 de Julio on Caseros Street 549, two blocks from Total Hostel. The museum features paintings, carriages, furniture, pianos, and belongings of historical figures such as Martín Miguel de Güemes, an important Argentine political figure who fought in the 'Guerra Gaucha' against Spanish royalists for Argentina's independence."
